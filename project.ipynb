    "# Introduction\n",
    "In the world of digital interfaces, the choice between light and dark themes is a topic of ongoing debate. This study undertakes a simple exploration: do these themes matter to users? I approach this question with a meticulous investigation, aiming to provide straightforward answers. By understanding the user perspective in clear terms, I try to contribute valuable insights to the conversation on interface design."

    "Study was done as an **independent samples t-test** with **95% Confidence Interval** where participants were sampled with usage of **randomized controlled trial (RCT)**. The T-Test was chosen as the Population Variance was unknown and the sample size was more than 30, but still small. **The explanatory variable was dark mode or light mode option**, **the response variables were rating of website and engagement time** and **the experimental units were people**. One group was offered a website with dark mode and the other group was offered a website with light mode. The aim was to get **80 responses** (40 for each group) in the period of 2 weeks.\n",
    "People were randomly selected for the test using this schema:\n",
    "* Random number between 1 and 2 (1 dark mode, 2 light mode)\n",
    "* Find first person\n",
    "* Depending on the random number first person is shown appropriate website\n",
    "* Find second person\n",
    "* Depending on the random number second person is shown other website\n",
    "* Repeat\n",

    "In order for the experiment inference to be valuable those conditions need to be met:\n",
    "* Random: A random sample or randomized experiment should be used to obtain the data.\n",
    "* Normal: The sampling distribution of sample x (the sample mean) needs to be approximately normal. This is true if our parent population is normal or if our sample is reasonably large (n $\\ge$ 30).\n",

    "**Normal** was met by having two sample groups of 40 participants.\n",

    "\n",
    "Bias in samples and surveys:\n",
    "* **Voluntary Response Bias** was avoided as the response was not voluntary.\n",
    "* **Response Bias** was avoided, because it's doubtful people would be systematically dishonest on this topic.\n",

    "It is essential to acknowledge the constraints that influence the scope of research study.\n",
    "* Firstly, the participant pool leaned towards male Information and Communication Technology (ICT) students, aged between 20 and 25, with a smaller representation from Physiotherapy students. This demographic bias could restrict the generalizability of the findings to a broader audience.\n",
    "* Secondly, the study encompassed a sample size of 80 participants. While it offered some insights, a larger and more diverse sample would enhance the study's reliability and applicability.\n",
    "* Additionally, this research marks the initial exploration of this particular topic. Consequently, despite rigorous methodologies, the study’s novelty might pose challenges in terms of comprehensive coverage and depth of analysis. These limitations, while significant, provide valuable pointers for future studies, encouraging a broader and more inclusive approach to understanding user preferences in interface themes."

The intricate interplay of user preferences and contexts renders a precise determination challenging. To comprehensively understand the impact of interface themes on user satisfaction within the same website, further research involving diverse user groups and scenarios is imperative."
